# Testing JavaScript
## Testing Basics
**T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment, or TDD for short, is a *big* deal in modern
JavaScript development. The main idea is that you start working on your code by 
writing automated tests *before* writing the code that is being tested.

There are many JavaScript test-running systems available:
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
- [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

They all have their own set of special features, but the basic syntax for each 
one is almost identical.
