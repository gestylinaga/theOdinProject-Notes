# Etch-a-Sketch
a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch

```javascript
/* Prompt
  1. create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
    - create the divs with javascript, NOT HTML
    - its best to put the grid squares in another 'container' div
    - different ways to make a grid:
      - float/clear
      - inline-block
      - flexbox
      - CSS grid
  2. set up a 'hover' effet that changes the color of the divs
    - hint event listener on the divs
    - multiple ways to change div colors:
      - adding a new class
      - changing the div's bg color using javascript
  3. add button to top of screen, that sends a popup, asking for number of grid 
    squares
    - new grid should take up same space
    - set limit of grid squares to 100x100
    - button HTML tags to run javascript functions
    - use prompt() for popup

  Extra Credit:
    - instead of white to black, random RGB values on mouse hover
    - each mouse pass only adds 10% of color, only completely colored on 10 
    passes
