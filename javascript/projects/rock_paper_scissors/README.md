# Rock Paper Scissors
a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game - 
Project for 'Basics' Section

Includes a `.html` file, using `prompt()` and `alert()` in the JavaScript for browser interactivity.

[See the Script](./script.js)

```javascript
/* Prompt:
  * a 'getComputerChoice' function that randomly returns a choice
  
  * a 'playRound' function that plays a round, takes 2 params:
    * 'playerSelection'
    * 'computerSelection'
    * returns a win/loss string: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
  * 'playerSelection' needs to be case-insensitive
  * tip: use 'prompt()' to get user input
  
  * a 'game' function that calls 'playRound' to:
    * play 5 rounds
    * keep score
    * display winner/loser at the end
  * tip: use a for loop to iterate the rounds
*/
