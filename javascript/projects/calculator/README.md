# Calculator
a simple browser-based calculator - project for 'basics' section

```javascript
/* Prompt
  * Functions for basic math operators
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide
  * 'operate' function that takes 2 numbers and calls an above function
  * Create a basic HTML calculator with a display & buttons:
    - each digit
    - each operator
    - equals '='
    - clear 'C'
  * A function to populate the display
    - & saving the 'display value' into a variable for future use
  * Make the calculator functional
    - store input numbers
    - save operator used
    - call 'operate()' when '=' is pressed
    - update display with solution

  * Gotchas:
    - users should be able to string several operations together
    - calculator should NOT evaluate more than a single pair at a time
    - should round answers with long decimals to avoid overflow
    - 'error' if '=' is pressed too early in operation
    - 'C' clear should completely clear existing data
    - specific 'error' is trying to divide by zero

  * Extra Credit:
    - allow floating point numbers (decimals)
      - disable decimal button is one is already present
    - add a 'backspace' button
    - add keyboard support
