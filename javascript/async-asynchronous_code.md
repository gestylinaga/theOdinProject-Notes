# Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs
## Asynchronous Code
Since JavaScript is the language of the web, there are some functions that by 
necessity are going to take a decent amount of time to complete, like fetching 
data from a server to display on your site. Because of this, JavaScript includes
support for *asynchronous* functions, aka functions that can happen in the 
background while the rest of your code executes.
