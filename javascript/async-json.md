# Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs
## JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standardized format for structuring data.
It is heavily based on the syntax for JavaScript objects.

### Working with JSON
[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) - 
tutorial on 'Working with JSON'

Even though JSON closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be 
used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature 
the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.

JSON exists as a string, which is useful for transmitting data across a network.
It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object before accessing the 
data.

A JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file 
with an extension of `.json`, and a MIME type of `application/json`.
