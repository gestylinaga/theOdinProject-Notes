# Sign-up Form
a fake sign-up form for an imaginary service - Project for 'Forms' Section

Prompt:
```html
<!-- Step 1 - Setup & Planning
  - set up HTML / CSS files with dummy content
  - download reference image, for general idea of layout
-->

<!-- Step 2 - Gather Assets
  - Choose background image
  - Pick an external font for the 'logo' section
  - Pick a .png logo
-->

<!-- Step 3 - Some Tips
  - Start by scaffolding out the structure, then take the sections one by one
  - The area behind the logo is a div with a dark, but semi-transparent bg color
  - The color for the 'Create Account' button is based off the bg color
  - The inputs, by default have a light border (#E5E7EB), the password inputs should
    be given an 'error' class
  - The 'selected' input should have a blue border, & subtle box-shadow 
    (use the ':focus' pseudo-class)
  - Don't worry about mobile view, but account for some reactivity
  - Checking if the password fields match requires JavaScript, this is optional
-->
